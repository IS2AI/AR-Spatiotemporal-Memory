This repository contains the source code developed for human memory augmentation system, ExoMem. ExoMem is the first Augemnted Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhanced cognitive assistant that can construct a synthetic spatiotemporal memory for objects in an indoor environment. The system has two components: AR Goggles Microsoft HoloLens 2 and Laptop computer with running AI algorithms. Microsoft HoloLens sense the environment, exchange data over a wireless network and construct a spatiotemporal memory in the AR environment. A computing module performs computer vision-based localization and object detection on first-person view (FPV) data received from the AR goggles
